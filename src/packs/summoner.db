Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness. This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar. Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight! Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Chitter Chatter.</strong>&nbsp;Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp. What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night. The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath. The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes. It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select:

Weasels are tiny, long bodied mammals reaching approximately eight inches in length and bearing coat colorations ranging from chestnut brown to pale white. The weasel&rsquo;s long body allows it to easily wedge itself into a rodent&rsquo;s burrow and pull the critter out for a tasty meal. Weasels make quite effective pest controllers in their territories as they eat multitudes of rodents annually. These little cleaners are, however, often considered to be pests in their own right; farmers across the countryside report that their poultry is killed or stolen away by sneaky weasels making their way into their chicken coops. While not the most deadly mammal in the world, the weasel does pack a nasty, sharp-toothed bite. Keep your curious fingers out of any small rodent burrows you find, lest you end up provoking a weasel during his well-earned meal.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;

Another bird of prey, the hawk may be differentiated from eagle species by its smaller frame. Hawks on average weigh no more than eight pounds and have a wingspan of only five feet. These miniscule raptors bear dark brown to deep red plumage unlike the eagle&rsquo;s most common golden hue. Several species of these birds of prey have been observed employing different tactics in their hunting patterns as well; while the mighty eagle soars down from on high and lifts its prey off into the air with it, hawks prefer to lurk in the cover of trees, waiting for the opportune time to swoop in and surprise their prey from the shadows. Due to their keen eyesight as well as their smaller profile, hawks have been utilized as messenger birds by desert cultures for centuries. Clever and loyal, the hawk may be an option for the adventurer who prefers a raptor who enjoys the cover of shadows and stealth to aid them in their hunts.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; font-size: 13px; color: #111111;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":"Beast","background":"","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":300,"pct":null},"appearance":"","trait":"","ideal":"","bond":"","flaw":"","notesname":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":"","level":0},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"toolProf":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":0,"total":3,"passive":13},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":2,"total":4,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":0,"total":3,"passive":13},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":0,"total":3,"passive":13},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"primary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""},"secondary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""},"tertiary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Hawk.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Hawk","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Hawk.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"9TwGi0SRTHeBRQQ2","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"bjbIojwaxGIJPvXx","name":"Talons","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The Hawk rakes at your eyes with hooked avian talons.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":null,"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":"","attuned":false,"equipped":true,"rarity":"Common","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"dex","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1 -

Approximately the size of an adult human&rsquo;s fist, these tiny beasts are ravenous when they sense any scrap of food is nearby. The quipper&rsquo;s jaw is lined with a jagged row of dagger-sharp teeth which they use to strip flesh from bones at lightning speed. The quipper&rsquo;s ability to see even within the darkness of a frigid cavern lake makes them extremely deadly to the unwary traveler who takes an accidental plunge into the darkened waters. Though it is not entirely unheard of to see quippers on their own it is far more common that they travel in swirling swarms. These clouds of razor-toothed fish can sense blood in the water from great distances, able to sniff a single drop of the life giving fluid in over 200 liters of water. I suggest that any adventurer steer well clear of any water they are not certain is free of quippers.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; font-size: 13px; color:

Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human&rsquo;s hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab&rsquo;s ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar&rsquo;s eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #111111;\"><em

These octopods resemble nothing more than a wet piece of bulbous taffy with eight sprawling tentacles slithering out of its central body. Upon this gelatinous body lie two observant eyes and were one to look underneath the creature they would find a sharpened bird-like beak ready to steal a probing finger away. Octopi are solely waterborne animals due to their inability to breathe air, though with effort they may remain upon land for very short durations. Sailors find pleasure in attempting to take these intelligent beasts for pets, only to find that the octopus has escaped whatever confines it was stored in time and time again. As long as an opening is as wide as its hard chitinous beak, the moldable octopus&rsquo; body will follow into inconceivably tight spaces.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">Many breeds of octopus also bear special pigmentation cells which expand and contract to change their body&rsquo;s color. This provides the octopus with an advantage when hunting for its prey of fish and crabs as they can blend in almost seamlessly with the ocean floor or a bed of coral. Rather than outright fight (unless left with no choice) the octopus has the unique defense of spraying a cloud of ink from the underside of its body to blind its foes and make a speedy escape. Do consider the octopus as a worthy familiar form should you find yourself at sea for an extended time!</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; font-size: 13px; color: #111111;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"ANY","race":"BEAST","background":"","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":300,"pct":null},"appearance":"","trait":"","ideal":"","bond":"","flaw":"","notesname":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":"","level":0},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"Darkvision 30 FT","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"toolProf":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":2,"total":2,"passive":12},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":2,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":2,"total":4,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"primary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""},"secondary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""},"tertiary":{"value":null,"max":null,"sr":false,"lr":false,"label":""}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Octopus.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Octopus","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Octopus.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"L0RppmnCkop7fWxe","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"5YnbWkifGk5CXl91","name":"Tentacles","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The octopus wraps the target in its strong rubbery tentacles.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>The target is @JournalEntry[Grappled] (escape DC 10).

These four legged friends are of course familiar to all whom read this tome and can come in thousands of various breeds and sizes. What makes these little reptiles so very unique (and possibly a fine form for your familiar) is their ability to cling to a multitude of surfaces. Adept at climbing, lizards may scale sheer surfaces and procure hidden vantage points from which to gaze down upon those you may wish to observe. Some varieties of lizards are also able to shift the pigmentation of their flesh, allowing for further subterfuge options! However, the humble lizard does not provide much in the way of offense as their bite is nothing more than a nuisance to most humanoids.

Spiders are arachnids with eight thin legs protruding from their dual-segmented body. Atop the spider’s tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity. While the spider’s eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider’s web!</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Some Bug.</strong>&nbsp;Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes. Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators. Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption. While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels. Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; font-size: 13px; color: #111111;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Seahorses sport a narrow, long body ending in a curled tail with which they cling to sea plants. The seahorse&rsquo;s head is long and narrow (resembling its land-dwelling namesake) tipped with a flute-like nose. Seahorses lack many of the supportive fins in comparison to other sea creatures, rather they have one long fin along their spine and two miniscule fins on opposite sides of their torsos which allow the tiny creatures to propel themselves through the water. Unfortunately these docile creatures do not make the best familiar choices as they only inhabit tropical, shallow waters to utilize the cover of corals for protection. Seahorses should be observed and enjoyed, but I would advise endangering your familiar by placing it into this beautiful little form.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; font-size: 13px;

Owls are medium-sized birds of prey with flat, disk shaped faces and large dark eyes. A sharp beak sits at the center of their ovular face, built for tearing the flesh of small rodents. As deadly as they are silent, owls are nocturnal beasts who hunt from the shadows of treetops, barn lofts, or simply high above in an open field. Owls are able to fly in near silence due to a set of specialized feathers along their wing-tops, giving them the ability to glide down and surprise an unsuspecting vole without ever being heard. Owls are not the most sociable creatures, preferring to keep to their roosts in solitude making them treasured by arcanists as the bird primarily sits quietly throughout the day, lost in sleep. Owls also have a unique vocalization among birds, emitting a mournful hoot-hoot sound rather than the typical songbird tweeting. Perhaps consider the owl should you be uninterested in sociable animals or if you wish to send messages in relative secrecy in the dead of night.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select:

The cat proves time and time again to be a prized companion whether they are keeping your property free of unwanted pests or cuddling up upon their master&rsquo;s lap for a cozy night within the study. Found in a number of varieties from the pure black short-haired cats associated with ill omens to the fluffy coated and absurdly flat-faced cats of the frozen north, there appears to be limitless breeds to select from. (Author&rsquo;s Note: I have recently heard rumor of a cat which produces no hair, requiring its master to simply stroke its flesh without pleasant barriers. More evidence forthcoming of this unfounded discovery). However, our feline compatriots have much more to offer when looked at under the shrewd eye of the adventurer!</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Purrfect Pals.</strong>&nbsp;Be it at the side of the elder potion-maker tucked safely away in their shop or out with the upstart young ranger braving the rolling fields of the hinterlands, cats are found dotted all across our marvelous land. Compact and light in weight, these agile little hunters fit perfectly atop one&rsquo;s shoulder or nestled within a wagon&rsquo;s goods. Cats provide useful utility to the crafty conjurer who binds their familiar to such a form as well; with honed claws able to retract in a lighting&rsquo;s flash back into their paws the cat makes for a deadly hunter against smaller beasts. Cats also have a flexible spine allowing them to squeeze into difficult to reach places should you coax them adequately or even survive a perilous fall. Researchers have discovered that cats seem to have the uncanny ability to land upon their feet regardless of the angle at which they are dropped; surely this is an astonishing advantage over other less agile creatures! Deathly quiet (unless they prefer to pester their master for tasty morsels with a noisome yowl) a cat is an adequate infiltrator should one prefer to observe their surroundings from a safer distance through this familiar&rsquo;s eyes. Be they conjured or corporeal, it is this author&rsquo;s opinion that the common cat is a companion of quality and should be considered when seeking the appropriate animal ally.</p>\n<ul

The ebony feathered bird reaches height of nearly two and a half feet tall and bears a thick, dark beak which is perfectly utilized in its scavenging diet of carrion, unattended grains, and insects. However, something truly special lurks behind the dark abyss of this bird&rsquo;s eyes. Should you be prepared, adventurer, the effort put into training the raven will be given back tenfold.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Musings and Mimicry.</strong>&nbsp;Ravens are unique specimens among birds; by listening intently and practicing often the raven is able to mimic sounds it hears perfectly. From noises of forest animals to the precise timbre of their master&rsquo;s call, ravens are among the most seamless mimics to be found in the animal kingdom. Truly adventurer, the possibilities to employ the raven&rsquo;s mimicry are nearly limitless! You may see another example of this perfect mimicry in a larger cousin to this bird as well: the humanoid Kenku. Raven-like in form these little humanoids share the feathers and large beaks of their brethren, as well as their ability to copy the sounds of the world around them. Consider a second listen when you hear a voice but cannot place its location, for perhaps the raven speaks from the rafters above you, upon a midnight dreary.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Frogs live a primary amount of their lives in and around sources of water which makes them common to swamps, marshes, and bogs. This, of course, is necessary as without a nearby source of water the frog&rsquo;s slick skin would dry out and kill the frog. Insect eaters by nature, the frog utilizes its long, sticky tongue to capture all manner of insects (Author&rsquo;s Note: In the swamps of the south, eye witnesses have sworn to have seen a frog species large enough that they ate small birds plucked right from the air!). Frogs have a unique manner of locomotion as their hind legs are far longer and folded in comparison to their front appendages. This unique evolution allows the frog to hop about and make quite fantastic jumps when fully extending its hind legs.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tadpole evolved into Frog.</strong>&nbsp;Frogs begin their lives as nothing more than a jelly-like egg the size of a pinky nail. Upon hatching, the tiny frogs now in their tadpole state resemble miniature living comets, being hardly more than a ovular head and long swishing tail to propel themselves through the water. Over the course of several weeks the baby frogs develop limbs and fully evolve into their more recognizable adult form. Truly a fascinating process of development most often seen in insect species that our researchers have dubbed &ldquo;metamorphosis&rdquo;. What other creatures of our ever changing world could possess such a fantastic transformation as the common frog?</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size:

Resembling nothing more than a scaly worm at first look, snakes are actually highly developed predators who slither across the ground in order to stealthily hunt their prey of smaller reptiles, rodents, and birds. Though there are many species of snake, we will only discuss the poisonous varieties within this article. Poisonous snakes bear a marked identifier separating them from their nonpoisonous brethren: the shape of their pupils. While snakes lacking venom glands have rounded pupils, those snakes with a venomous bite have slitted pupils much like those of a common domestic cat. The devious snake, however, has so much more beneath its scaly surface.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Don't Tread on Me.</strong>&nbsp;Ever camouflaged both by their similarities to roots, sticks, or branches as well as the marvelous patterns of black, browns, greens, and tans speckling their hides, snakes are masters of blending into their surroundings. Even perched on a rock to warm their bodies in the heat of the sun, snakes can certainly be missed by just a passing glance. While the creature's eyesight is relatively poor, snakes have adapted an amazing ability to sense the world around them. Snakes \"smell\" with their tongues! Yes, by flicking their tongues out of their mouths with a fascinating flourish, these reptiles are able to smell prey or predators in their environment by collecting the miniscule scents on their tongues. Within the snake's mouth lies its most deadly asset in the form of two, hollow fangs. Snakes prefer to strike from the shadows, allowing their quiet method of travel to get them close enough to their prey to avoid a fight. The creature then lashes out in the blink of an eye, catching the unwary prey in their jaws while injecting them with a controlled dose of highly toxic venom through their hollow fangs. Then it's only a matter of moments until the poor creature is left dead by the snake's potent toxins. While the majority of snake species are not deadly to humanoids, caution is advised for those not well versed in identifying reptiles. Antidote should always be carried in areas known to house populations of poisonous snakes, just in case.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; font-size: 13px; color:

Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to. These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves. Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door. Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant&rsquo;s abode.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Rats Off to You.</strong>&nbsp;While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures. Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals. A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself. Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur. Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth. Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;
