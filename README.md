## Kobold Press OGL Compendium

## Summoner

DnD5e compendium for spells like Find Familiar

This FoundryVTT Module adds a simple compendium pack to help with DnD5e spells that summon creatures.
It is nothing fancy. My players were casting find familiar and I tried to use the npc creatures that
are in the DnD5e system and it wasn't working.  So all I did was create actor/player types for each 
creature they could summon.

Hope this saves you some time.  

Right now this only supports the following spells:
* Find Familiar
* Unseen Servant

### Updated

* Added new find familiar macro. You can find it in the macro compendium.

### How to Use It

* Go to the compendium tab and you will find the Summoner compendium.
* Select the creature that the player wants to summon and right click it and select import
* Finally, assign permissions to the player so they can interact with the token.

## Supplemental Bestiary Pack

A module that adds homebrew creatures to your D&D 5e game.

### Description

This module contains additional homebrewed monsters for D&D 5E to be used in Foundry VTT.
* Current Count: 45
